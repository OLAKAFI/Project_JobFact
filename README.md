## 1.  Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, Data analyst role is filtered by average anual salary and location, focusing on only remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.


```sql
SELECT 
    company_dim.name as company, 
    job_title_short, job_country, 
    job_schedule_type, 
    salary_year_avg,
    job_health_insurance,
    job_posted_date
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim
ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```



### Some Insights
- **Wide Salary Rnage:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000. This signifies the salary potential of these role.

- **Diverse Employers:** It can also be deduced that companies like SmartAsset, Meta, and AT&T are among those that offers high salaries. Another insight that can deduced is the industry diversity of these top paying companies.

- **Job Title Variety:** High diversity in job title is discovered in these set ranging from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics, reflecting varied roles and specializations within data analytics.

### Insights on Companies and Salaries
**Top Paying Companies:** 
Mantys (India) offers the highest average annual salary at $650,000.
Meta (United States) offers a significantly high salary at $336,500, positioning it as a leader in the U.S. market.
AT&T (United States) and Pinterest are also among the top-paying companies in the U.S., with average salaries of $255,829.5 and $232,423, respectively.

**Salary Distribution:**
The average annual salaries for these top roles range from $184,000 to $650,000, reflecting the high compensation packages offered by leading companies.
Companies like SmartAsset appear twice in the list, with slightly different salary averages, indicating different roles or levels within the same company.

**Health Insurance Offerings:**
Notably, companies such as AT&T, SmartAsset, and Get it Recruit provide health insurance as part of their job benefits, which may contribute to their attractiveness despite slightly lower salaries compared to the top-paying companies. Wheraas, other companies, including Meta, Pinterest, and Mantys, do not offer health insurance, suggesting that these companies may prioritize higher salaries over other benefits.

**Geographical Insights:**
India is represented by Mantys with a competitive salary offering. However, the U.S. dominates the list, showcasing the countryâ€™s strong demand and lucrative compensation for data analysts. The salaries in the U.S. tend to be significantly higher compared to the role listed in India, reflecting differences in market rates and living costs.

**Summary:**
Meta and AT&T stand out for offering some of the highest salaries, but they differ in their approach to benefits, with AT&T providing health insurance.
The presence of companies like SmartAsset twice in the list suggests a robust demand for data analysts in certain firms, possibly indicating multiple openings or specialized roles. The lack of health insurance in some top-paying roles may reflect a trend where companies compensate with higher salaries instead of benefits.
These insights could help job seekers understand where the most lucrative opportunities are and what trade-offs might exist between salary and benefits.
